# Backup and Restore SDK BOSH release

The Backup and Restore SDK BOSH release is used for two distinct things:

1. enabling release authors to incorporate database backup & restore functionality in their releases (See _[Database Backup and Restore](docs/database-backup-restore.md)_)
1. enabling operators to configure their deployments which use external blobstores to be backed up and restored by [BBR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore) (See _[Blobstore Backup and Restore](docs/blobstore-backup-restore.md)_)

## Developing

This repository using develop as the main branch, tested releases are tagged with their versions, and master branch represents the latest release.

## Testing

### Unit tests
The unit tests make use of ruby, go, and ginkgo. The easiest way to
run them is to use our docker files, which provide versions of these
dependencies that we've already tested. You can do this with:

```
make unit
```

If you want to run the tests using your local development tools,
without using docker, you can run:

```
make local-unit
```

Individual targets exist for individual unit tests, like `make
docker-unit-blobstore-gcs` and `make local-unit-blobstore-gcs`. Check
the Makefile for all available targets

### Contract tests

To run the Blobstore contract tests, you'll need to export the environment
variables the particular test requires. Check the [sdk-unit-blobstore pipeline
task](ci/tasks/sdk-unit-blobstore/task.yml) for details.

### System tests

To run the system tests, you'll need to export the necessary environment
variables that the particular test requires.

See the [sdk-system-blobstore pipeline
task](ci/tasks/sdk-system-blobstore/task.yml) and [sdk-system-db pipeline
task](ci/tasks/sdk-system-db/task.yml) for more details.

You'll also need a bosh director with a few particular bosh releases deployed in
it. Given a bosh director exists, the [infrastructure pipeline](ci/pipelines/bbr-sdk-test-infrastructure/pipeline.yml)
can be set to deploy the necessary releases.
